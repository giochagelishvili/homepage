                Hello, as I said on the homepage, my name is Gio (Giorgi) Chagelishvili. I am 22 years old and
                I live in Georgia. It is located next to Azerbaijan, Russia, Armenia, and Turkey.
                My people are known for our national cuisine and for the Didgori battle, which took place in 1121.
                It was a great victory against the Seljuk Turks. Our king, David IV "the builder", led our people
                in the battle against an army three times greater than ours, but Georgia won that day.
                <br>
                <br>
                Anyway, enough about my country. I should talk about myself. I was born and raised in Rustavi.
                I went to public school, and I wasn't the best-behaved kid, but I was smart
                (at least that's what my teachers told me back then). I made it to the end of high school and applied
                to the Agricultural University of Tbilisi, where I wanted to study business administration. Later,
                I realized it was not exactly what I thought it would be, so I paused my studies there.
                After working in sales for a year, I decided to take a break. During that time, I discovered
                my interest in programming. I didn't know where to start, so I turned to YouTube. I started
                learning HTML & CSS, but it didn't go well, and I lost my motivation for some time.
                Then I found out about a Facebook group (credits to BitCamp) that offered a free programming course.
                I was very surprised and went back to it. I started with Karel, and it went pretty well.
                I learned more about web development concepts and decided to go all-in, which I did.
                As I have been taking CS50, I feel I am becoming more professional, and I believe I will be among
                the best someday. Now, we can take a look at the skills I have developed so far.
