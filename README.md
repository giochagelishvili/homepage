# HOMEPAGE Website (CS50)

I am pleased to present my recent project, which is my personal homepage. This project was part of the Harvard CS50 course that I am currently taking, and it proved to be more challenging than I initially anticipated. To develop this webpage, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as my primary tools.

The most demanding aspect of the project was the design phase. I had to create everything from scratch, without relying on pre-existing images, gradient codes, fonts, font sizes, or any other design elements. I had to devise a design strategy and create the page layout myself. Although this was my first time developing a design and turning it into a functional website, I am satisfied with the outcome. The website features some information about me, and overall, I found the project to be enjoyable and engaging.
