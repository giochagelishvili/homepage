                I have to say, I have had a passion for computers and programming since a young age, but I never
                looked at it as a profession. I had a variety of skills even as a kid: I could use Photoshop,
                I knew how to download video games (pirated ones) and fix them in case they didn't work.
                I knew how to properly Google things, which, I think, is one of the best skills one can have.
                I knew how to fix issues connecting to the internet and how to install different parts of a computer.
                As for my programming skills, we can list them as follows:

                To be honest, I don't have a favorite between HTML and CSS. I find them equally interesting.
                HTML allows you to build the entire markup from scratch, requiring you to follow the proper
                structure and choose the right elements for content. Meanwhile, CSS lets you beautify all the
                markup created with HTML. I find both of these skills fascinating, as I enjoy making things
                aesthetically pleasing. Although I didn't have much direct experience with JavaScript until CS50,
                I really like how it allows you to manipulate things and am eager to get some more knowledge about it.
                <br><br>
                I enjoyed learning C because it presented challenging problems that required careful attention
                to detail. You had to meticulously identify variables and think critically about your code.
                Python, on the other hand, was an easier version of C for me. I appreciated how effortlessly
                I could write the same code in Python that I had written in C. SQL was also interesting for
                its ability to manipulate and represent data so easily. Overall, I'm satisfied with my progress
                over the past year, and I'm confident that I can continue to develop my skills and become a
                professional in this field.

                Until then, we can take a look of some of my projects.
